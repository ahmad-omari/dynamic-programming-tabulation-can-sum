# Dynamic Programming Tabulation "Can Sum"

The function ‘canSum(targetSum, numbers)‘ that takes in a
targetSum of Integer and array of numbers as arguments.

* The function returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.
* Using an element of the array multiple times is allowed.
* Notice that all input numbers are non-negative numbers.

# Complexity

Assume that:
m = targetSum
n = numbers array length

Time Complexity is O(n * m)
Space Complexity is O(m)
